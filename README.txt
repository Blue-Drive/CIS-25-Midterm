Part 1: 1.1: Function calculate area multiplies length and width and returns it to calling location.
	1.2: Function isPrime contains for loop that triggers if number is larger than 2, checks if divisible by whole number. If it gets 
	through loop and is not a 1, returns true, if 1, returns false.

Part 2: 2.1: For loop counts up from one to 50, printing each number along the way.
	2.2: Creates array and counter, while loop continues accepting user input until array is full, for loop prints out each index.

Part 3: 3.1: Creates variables for name, age, and favorite number. Accepts input for each then prints them out.
	3.2: Creates required variables, prints them out.

Part 4.1: takes three integers and arguments and checks which one is largest by using three if statements, one nested, and four return;s
	this was the simplest/most elegant solution I found using if statements. 

Part 4.2: Function uses && || and ! to determine if argument year/number is divisible by four but not 100s with the exception of 400s.

Part 5: when run will take user input for the first number, the operator(+,-,*,/), and the second number, send it to a function,
 	have a switch statement perform the operation based of given operator symbol, and return result to location of function call.

Par 6: changed = to == in first if statement declaration, removed semicolon after for loop declaration.
